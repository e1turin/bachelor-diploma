  title: Declarative analysis in “Troitsk nu-mass” experiment
  abstract: >
    The modern scientific data processing is not only a collection of powerful
    algorithms but also a whole infrastructure of facilities for data reading,
    processing, and results output. As the amount of data grows, so grows a need
    for automation of the process. The proper automation requires not only improvement
    of existing frameworks, but also a search of new ways to organize data processing
    in a way it could be automated and parallelized. DataForge experimental framework
    solves some problems by making the analysis configuration declarative instead
    of imperative. In this article, we present a limited demonstration of the idea
    applied to “Troitsk nu-mass” experiment in the search for sterile neutrino.
